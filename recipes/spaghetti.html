      Million dollar spaghetti is the perfect combination of noodles, lean ground beef sauce, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream. It's
      unbelievably good!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings.</li>
      <li>Beef: Youâ€™ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer.</li>
      <li>Spaghetti sauce: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home.</li>
      <li>Butter: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti.</li>
      <li>
        Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy
        spaghetti sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water, then drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>Cook the beef on the stove and discard the grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the spaghetti sauce.</li>
      <li>Prepare the baking dish, then spread half of the noodles in the bottom.</li>
      <li>Top with the mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream.</li>
      <li>Cover with remaining spaghetti and butter.</li>
      <li>Pour the beef mixture over the spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30 minutes, top with cheese, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.</li>
    </ol>
